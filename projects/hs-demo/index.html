            <h2>Video Production</h2>
            <p>
                This is an archive of old work in 2D and 3D motion graphics while a member of CATCOM at the Center for Advanced Technologies at Lakewood High School. During the 3 years I was there, I acted as a 3D team member, then 3D coordinator, and finally Digital Video Coordinator. 2D work was done in Photoshop and AfterEffects. 3D work was modeled and rendered in Lightwave. Videos were edited using Avid Express.
